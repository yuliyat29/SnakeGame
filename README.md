Simple Controls: Use the keyboard arrow keys to control the snake's direction (up, down, left, right).
Game Over Handling: The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself. You can choose to play again or exit.

## Requirements

The game is console-based and lacks graphical user interface (GUI).
It may not work correctly on all systems due to the use of platform-specific functions for keyboard input and screen clearing.

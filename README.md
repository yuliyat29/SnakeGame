# SnakeGame in C++

This is a simple console-based Snake game implemented in C++. It provides a basic yet enjoyable gaming experience where players control a snake, guiding it to eat fruits while avoiding collision with walls and its own tail.

Features

Simple Controls: Use the keyboard arrow keys to control the snake's direction (up, down, left, right).
Two Game Modes: Choose between two game modes: killer walls (game over if the snake hits the wall) and transparent walls (the snake wraps around the screen).
Score Tracking: Keep track of your score as you eat fruits. Each fruit eaten increases your score by 10 points.
Game Over Handling: The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself. You can choose to play again or exit.

Requirements

C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
Standard C++ libraries
Limitations

The game is console-based and lacks graphical user interface (GUI).
It may not work correctly on all systems due to the use of platform-specific functions for keyboard input and screen clearing.
Future Improvements

Implement a graphical user interface for a more immersive gaming experience.
Add sound effects and animations.
Optimize code for better performance and readability.
Make the game compatible with a wider range of systems by removing platform-specific dependencies.
